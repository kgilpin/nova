NEW FEATURES
Probes should report on happenings at a star for a complete game turn
	Should be displayed in a separate, collapsable section of the UI
Change Deployment Orders to a pop-up
	All actions should show in pop-ups so that the game screen is not obscured
Applet should display all the stars that are in range of the selected star, including
	via routing
New game preview
  After the newGame page, the user should get a chance to look at the game change the home worlds which
    are assigned to the players
  The game can have an 'owner' which is allowed to make these changes?
Should be able to schedule the start time of the game
  Do this also from the 'game preview' page
  So perhaps we have 'create game' and 'configure game'
  On the configure game page you can also set the start date/time for the game
IM transport for alerts
  Can start with ICQ Pager / Jabber / e-mail for immediate notification of particular events
  http://www.echomine.org/projects/muse/jabber/
  http://jabberpy.sourceforge.net/
  ./jabberClient.py
Should be able to give cash to another player
Renaming stars
  Need to key stars in the applet by their ID rather than name
Built-in notion of treaties (agreements)
  Non-agression : cannot send ships or DPs to a star owned by that player
  	Be able to turn over a star to another player
  	CAN send spy probes
  Alliance
  	Stars can be routed through stars owned by another player
  	Cannot send spy probes
  	Other player can see all the information about your stars and fleets
Replay a period of the game in the applet

CLEANUP
Make the battle logic easier to understand
Purchase*Events are similar, should have a common base class
Are all Events invalid on dead stars?

BUGS
Add a Game.name field
Rename newGame.psp to newMatch.psp
GamePage should check that the playerId and password are valid for the game. Right now it just checks that they are non-empty
Applet doesn't work on OSX
	no LiveConnect
Applet background is White when rendered in Apple Safari
	Have added a fix for this in NovaApplet.paint(). not sure if it is working
APIs should take star IDs not star names
	did this for the dispatch.py dispatch methods, they take a String or an Id. Need to update the console.psp
	Dispatch and Purchase should select star based on ID not name
		Likewise for nova.api methods
Fleets should be drawn on top of everything
	numFactories seems to show through
Purchasing doesn't always come out to the exact expected number
Deployment screen should only show reachable stars
Applet player colors may change if they start a new browser
	Can do this with the cookie mechanism used to save the transformation settings
Should refresh a to-be-aborted event from the database before checking its Status

TEST
After last production, no 'Next production in' link shows up

COMPLETED
Separate user and player login
	user login is for non-match related actions, such as newGame.psp
build.xml#install needs to work when the DB has no password (should not pass -p argument to install script)
Default range should be 15
SQL error with "Hind's Crimson Star" (quote-related I'm sure)
	removed ' characters from starNames.xml
Need to add fleet.serialNum so that console.psp cancel will work
Complete XMLRPC API
	Move Webui to use XMLRPC API
Should rename Player.wealth to Player.cash
	This is done through the api beans
Blocked probes and nova bombs are not reported to the target player
Nova bombs may be shown twice in the News Wire
Collapsable Status and Fleets sections
Made left hand table wider so that routed fleets don't take up too much vertical space
Purchase page should show player cash
Star names in deployment orders should be sorted
Change Next Production to be a countdown (in hours)
Deployment orders can target any star, not just owned stars
Distances shown in the applet don't match actual distances exactly
Subtracting money and performing the game action is not transactional
	Make subtracting the money come last so that in the worst case, the player
	gets an error in his favor
Number of ships in transit does not include scheduled departures
Show final destination for a routed fleet
Enable a routed fleet to be aborted
Applet should preserve translation and zoom settings
UI for configuring communication/alerts
  Should be able to independently configure the 'triggers' and the 'medium'
  Triggers could be classes or functions found in a particular package
  The media are things like ICQ Pager, e-mail, etc
  Basically, want to be able to say things like:
    Alert by ICQ Pager immediately when one of my stars is attacked
	 Send daily e-mail which lists the stars that I have lost/gained
Standing orders
  Can be used to automatically send new production to a particular star on the map
Communication/Alerts preferences
  Will need a real framework for this
Routing instructions
  Automatically applied when ships arrive at a star
ProductionEvent should refer back to GlobalProductionEvent so that the News Wire entry for production
  is always accurate
Speed should be more expensive
  Maybe about $200 to double your initial speed?
  Is speed even an important part of the game?
Focus on a star
  Based on a user action on the web page, the applet pans to and highlights a particular star 	
  For example, you should be able to click on the name of a star in the News Wire, and the applet should
  	show you where that star is
UI should show when the next Production is going to occur
Game should not allow you to send a fleet that will arrive after the game is over
A Nova Bomb which is blocked by a shield should not be visible to all players
Events which require purchasing should consider the pending cost of spy probes and death probes
Fleets can be scheduled to go farther than they are capable of going
	DepartureEvent validation is not run for departures scheduled in the future
		(with a delay)
Fleets can be scheduled to leave a star in quantities exceeding the number of ships available
  However the fleets will not actually be able to leave
The UI shows the ships as being both part of the fleet, and part of the star's garrison
Figure out some nice formatting for dates and times. Showing 1/100s of a second right now
  WebKit has a formatter you can plug in
  This should simply be the name of a function that will format the values. By default it is 'str',
    it can be implemented to do something better for floating point numbers and dates
  See query.py#_formatMySQLDate
  format strings are according to the Python 'time' module
'Abort' feature for departure events
  Can implement this by:
    Having a 'delay by' field in the dispatch window
	 In place of the 'Time left' field in the Fleets table, show an 'Abort' button
	 'Abort' changes the state of the DepartureEvent to 'Aborted'
	 Must check that the DepartureEvent status is still Pending before doing this, 
	 otherwise it is too late
'Purchase' window is cluttered looking
  I think there should be a separate table row for each item you can purchase, with separate
    forms and separate validation
Need to implement purchase events for nova shield and probe jammer
  Need new objects in the schema
Can make probe jammers and nova shields cost different amounts than the probe and the nova bomb
  Just need to add 'cost' attributes to the Game
Need to keep web users from being able to save the source code
	  disable directory listing in .htaccess
Field validation for required fields and data types ( integers )
Ensure that playerName and User.name are unique to their contexts
  Should add some MySQL indexes and constraints to the schema
  see http://www.mysql.com/documentation/mysql/bychapter/manual_Reference.html#CREATE_INDEX
Should also add some indexes for common queries
  Star.gameId
  Star.ownerId
  ArrivalEvent, SpyProbeEvent, DeathProbeEvent, FieryDeathEvent, BattleEvent, DepartureEvent by playerId
