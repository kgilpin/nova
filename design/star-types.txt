Mechanism of type Ia supernovae
 big star passes material to a white dwarf which explodes
 'hydrogen bomb the size of the earth but the mass of the sun'

Main Sequence (bright,hot -> dark, cool)
 Sirius : brightest start in the sky
   companion white dwarf star Pup http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/glossary/indexs.shtml#Sirius
 Vega
Blue/White
 Canopus http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/brightest_stars_030715-2.html
  yellow/white F supergiant helium->carbon
 Procyon http://www.glyphweb.com/esky/_images/illustrations/procyon.gif
  bright binary
White Dwarf (dark, hot)
Blue Giant (bright, hot) 
 Rigel http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/glossary/indexr.shtml#Rigel
 Spica
Red (super)Giant (bright, cool)
 Arcturus http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/glossary/index.shtml#Arcturus
 Betelgeuse http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/glossary/indexb.shtml#Betelgeuse
 Antares variable red supergiant
 
Pulsar
 rapidly spinning neutron star

Yellow Dwarf
 Sun
Red Dwarf
 most common type of star
 Proxima Centauri

Red Giant
 Dwarf stars expand into red giants
 The sun will become a red giant in about 5 billion years
 Next stage is a White Dwarf and then a cold black dwarf

Blue Giant
 burns helium

Supergiant
 may be almost as large as our solar system
 Betelgeuse & Rigel
 become supernovae and then black holes

Reflection Nebula
 nebula which glows with reflected light from nearby stars
 http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/glossary/indexr.shtml#redgiant

Brown Dwarf
 not massive enough to be a true star

Neutron star
 small dense star composed mostly of packed neutrons + hydrogen atmosphere

Pulsar
 rapidly spinning neutron star

Binary star
 about half of all stars are part of a system of at least 2 stars

X-ray binary star
 binary star in which one star is a collapsed object such as a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole
