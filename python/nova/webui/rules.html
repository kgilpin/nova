	<h1>Nova : Game Rules</h1>
	</center>

	Your minions are like swarming, slavish ants. They are slavish in their obedience, and relentless in their quest for resources
	and territory. For millenia, they have grown, evolved, and consumed until their home planet is a teeming hive of restless biology.
	They have long known that their only option for further expansion is the colonization of other stars, a goal achievable only 
	through the development of hyperspace technology. At last, one race has developed such a capability and they gleefully prepare for
	galactic domination. But their joy soon turns to shock and alarm as spies spread the secret throughough the galaxy. The race is on!
	<p>
	Hyperspace travel is far too dangerous for a race of selfish, fragile beings. But the hive species have no fear or doubt; at once, they
	hurl themselves headlong into the unknown.
	<p>
	The objective of Nova is to spread out from your home star and take control of as many stars as possible. You face long odds
	and wily enemies. Choose your battles carefully...

	<a name="summary"><h2>Summary</h2></a>

	The rules of Nova are designed to be as simple as possible. In short:
	
	<ul>
	<li>Each player starts with one <a href="#starmap">star</a> and some ships</li>
	<li>Ships are <a href="#movement">dispatched</a> to <a href="#battles">attack</a> and gain control of other stars</li>
	<li>Stars <a href="#production">generate cash</a> which can be spent to build factories</li>
	<li><a href="#production">Factories</a> generate new ships once per turn</li>
	<li><a href="#probes_bombs">Probes</a> can be sent to spy on enemy stars</li>
	<li><a href="#probes_bombs">Nova Bombs</a> are an expensive but effective doomsday weapon</li>
	<li><a href="#notifications">E-mail notifications</a> and <a href="#deployment">deployment orders</a> help reduce your workload</li>
	<li>Some matches allow players to write and use their own <a href="#programming">AI programs</a></li>
	<li>You are encouraged to negotiate with, ally with, and deceive other players</li>
	<li>The player with the most stars at the end of the match, wins</li>
	</ul>

	A match can last anywhere from a few hours to 3 weeks. In long matches, the ships move very slowly; it can take all day to get from
	one star to another. In shorter matches, the ships move proportionately faster. A slow game allows a lot of time for strategy,
	negotiation with other players, and it is possible to play quite effectively spending only a few minutes making moves several times 
	during the day. In other words, it doesn't require a long block of continuous time to play; it goes very well with work or school.
	
	<a name="starmap"><h2>Star Map</h2></a>
	
	Study the star map carefully to consider your strategy. The distribution of the stars will play a large part in the decisions you will
	make about how to dispatch fleets and how to make peace and war on other species.
	<p>
	Every star has resources which you can use to develop your technology or build new assets. <i>All</i> the stars are inhabited
	at the beginning of the match, you will have to capture each one from its native inhabitants.
		
	<a name="movement"><h2>Fleet Movement</h2></a>
	
	Fighting fleets can be dispatched to any star that is within range. A star is within range if the distance to that star is less than
	your Range, or if it can be reached by a path involving only stars that you control. Fleets which are sent on long-distance trips
	always take the shortest path to their destination; the path is re-computed each time they arrive at a waypoint.
	<p>
	You can also configure <a href="#deployment">Deployment Orders</a> which automatically route ships around your stars.
	
	<a name="battles"><h2>Battles</h2></a>
	
	When your fleet arrives at a star that you don't control, a battle ensues. As you would expect from a battle between mindless,
	selfless warrior drones, no quarter is asked or given. The defender generally has the advantage; this advantage can be increased
	or nullified by decisive numerical superiority or inferiority. Specifically:

	<p>	
	<table border="1">
	<tr><th>Advantage</th><th>Attacker odds</th><th>Defender odds</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Attacker has 50%+ more ships</td><td>50%</td><td>50%</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Defender has 50%+ more ships</td><td>30%</td><td>70%</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Otherwise</td><td>40%</td><td>60%</td></tr>
	</table>
	</p>
	The battle proceeds in rounds. In each round, either the defender or the attacker loses a ship according to the odds table above.
	The odds are then re-computed, and the battle continues until either the attacker or the defender runs out of ships.
	<p>
	When one player captures a star from another, all players are informed about the transfer of ownership. However, only the participating
	players know how many ships were involved and how many were lost on each side. Other players are not informed when a star is successfully
	defended.
	
	<a name="production"><h2>Resources, Cash, and Factories</h2></a>

	At the end of each turn, the resources of each star are harvested and converted into cash currency, which you can spend on:
	<ul>
	<li>New factories</li>
	<li>Additional Range and Speed</li>
	<li><a href="#probes_bombs">Probes and Nova Bombs</a></li>
	<li><a href="#probes_bombs">Probe shields and Nova Bomb shields</a></li>
	</ul>
	The new cash from each of your stars is immediately deposited into an untouchable account; cash cannot be lost or stolen.
	<p>
	The galactic economy is generating the new cash as each factory simultaneously produces one new ship on its star.	
	<p>
	When a star is captured, ownership of all the resources and improvements (factories, shields, etc) on that star are immediately 
	transferred to the new owner. When resource harvest and ship production occurs, the cash and ships go to the current owner 
	of the star.

	<a name="probes_bombs"><h2>Probes and Nova Bombs</h2></a>

	Probes and Nova Bombs add more strategic options to the game.
	<p>
	Each player is kept informed about major events going on in the game through the Nova user interface. However, not much information
	is provided about the movements of other players. You can dispatch Probes to other stars in order to find out more specifically
	what other players are doing. If the destination star does not have a Probe shield, you will be told all about what is going
	on at that star; the other player will not know that the star has been probed. However, if the star has a Probe sheild,
	you receive no information and the other player is informed that a probe was blocked at the star (but not who sent the Probe).
	<p>
	When a star is captured in battle, the attacker takes posession of the resources and factories on the star. A Nova Bomb is
	a doomsday device that destroys the target star entirely, unless it has a Nova Bomb shield.
	<p>
	Probes and Nova Bombs travel at twice the speed of ships.
	
	<a name="notifications"><h2>Notifications</h2></a>

	It should not be necessary to frequently check the Nova web site to find out if significant game events have occurred.
	If you request it, Nova can send you e-mail when important events like battles occur. Please submit your suggestions on
	how Nova can proactively keep you updated regarding game events.
	
	<a name="deployment"><h2>Deployment Orders</h2></a>

	Deployment orders can be used to automatically route ships between stars. One deployment order can be specified for
	each star that you own. When ships arrive at the star or are produced by factories, they are immediately dispatched to
	the destination star specified by the deployment order. The order also specifies how many
	ships should be left on the star as a garrison to defend it.
	
	<a name="programming"><h2>Programming Nova</h2></a>

	Nova has an <a href="http://xmlrpc.org/">XML-RPC</a> API that you can use write Artificial Intelligence (AI) code. The following
	functions are available:
	
	<dl>
	<dt>getSnapshot
	<dd>Describes the stars, fleets, players, and recent game events which have occurred.
	<dt>dispatchFleet, dispatchProbe, dispatchNovaBomb
	<dd>Sends a fleet, probe, or Nova Bomb
	</dl>
	
	Not all matches permit the use of AI.
